# Simple radio telescope backend
Everything working in progress...

## About this project
This is a simple backend of radio telescope. 
It reads raw "baseband"/"intermediate frequency" voltage data and should be capable of coherent dedispersion, radio frequency interference mitigation and single pulse signal detection in real-time, with spectrum waterfall shown in GUI.

Possible future plans include DPDK integration, search of disperse measurements, correction of antenna polarizations, pulsar folding backend, etc.

Due to **vendor neutrality** and API complexity,
[SYCL 2020](https://www.khronos.org/sycl/) from Khronos Group is chosen as target API.
Although say so, currently only CPU (OpenMP, on amd64), ROCm and CUDA backends are tested, due to limited device types available; another backend is working-in-progress.
Mainly used SYCL implementations are [hipSYCL](https://github.com/illuhad/hipSYCL) and [intel/llvm](https://github.com/intel/llvm/)

> It is noticed that there has been a tendency to equate GPU with CUDA, especially in HPC and AI.  
> It must be emphasized that GPU != CUDA, there do exist other vendors that should not be neglected.

This is only an undergraduate "research" project written by a newbie of radio astronomy, so many things are naively implemented. 
Corrections and suggestions are very appreciated!

```bash
git submodule update --init
```
if you have cloned this repo.

Then please refer to [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md)

### Example Setup
Tested setup:
* AMD Rembrandt CPU + AMD GPU (gfx906; gfx1035)
  * with hipSYCL HIP backend & intel/llvm HIP backend
  * hipfft interop disabled for gfx1035 due to Segmentation Fault (as it is unsupported hardware)
* Intel Ice Lake CPU + NVIDIA GPU (GA102; GA104)
  * with hipSYCL CUDA backend & intel/llvm CUDA backend
* Intel Ice Lake CPU
  * with hipSYCL CPU backend (CBS enabled)
  * may extended to any CPU with C++ support
* AMD Rembrandt CPU
  * same as above
  * also with intel/llvm OpenCL SPIR-V backend + [intel/opencl-intercept-layer](https://github.com/intel/opencl-intercept-layer) + [PoCL](http://portablecl.org/) CPU backend
    * intel/opencl-intercept-layer used for USM -> SVM emulation:
```bash
export LD_PRELOAD=/opt/opencl-intercept-layer/lib/libOpenCL.so
export CLI_Emulate_cl_intel_unified_shared_memory=1
export CLI_SuppressLogging=1
```
* [DATA EXPUNGED] CPU + [DATA EXPUNGED] ([DATA EXPUNGED])

To be tested:
* mesa rusticl!
* Intel/AMD server/laptop CPU + [DATA EXPUNGED]

Tested NOT supported:
* Codeplay ComputeCpp Experimental 2.11
  * header not compatible with C++20
  * segmentation fault in runtime library, not open-source so no way to debug

## Usage
Beside compile-time configurations (see [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md)), 
there are also runtime configurations that can be input with priority 
by command-line > by config file > default value

An example config file is at `userspace/srtb_config.cfg`; meanings of these
variables are in `srtb/config.cpp` and `srtb/program_options.hpp`, `--help` option can also be used.

<summary><b>Additional steps if operating with UDP packets in real time</b></summary>

* upgrade kernel and system libraries to use newer CPU instructions
* enlarge kernel buffer for networking, e.g.

```ini
net.core.rmem_max = 536870912
net.core.wmem_max = 536870912
net.core.rmem_default = 536870912
net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 5000
net.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling = 1
net.ipv4.udp_rmem_min = 8388608
```

* check MTU setting of NIC
* move NIC and GPU to same NUMA node, topology can be viewed using tools like `lstopo` from hwloc
* force running on this NUMA node ("`$NODE`") using `numactl` & set process priority (nice value, "`$NICE`"):
```bash
sudo numactl --preferred $NODE nice $NICE simple-radio-telescope-backend
```

* set thread affinity of baseband/IF UDP receiver thread(s), using `udp_receiver_cpu_preferred` option

### Files
<details>

* `userspace/include/srtb/`
  * `config`: compile-time and runtime configurations
  * `work`: defines input of each pipe
  * `global_variables`: stores *almost* all global variables, mainly work queues of pipes (TODO: better ways?)
  * `pipeline/`: components of the pipeline
    * each pipe defines its input work type in `work.hpp`, reads work from the `work_queue` defined in `global_variables.hpp`, do some transformations on the data, and wrap it as the work type of next pipe.
  * `fft/`: wrappers of FFT libraries like fftw, cufft and hipfft
  * `gui/`: user interface to show spectrum, based on Qt5
  * `io/`: read raw "baseband" data
    * `udp_receiver`: from UDP packets using Boost.Asio
    * `rdma`: (TODO, is this needed?) maybe operate a custom driver to read data from network device, then directly transfer to GPU using Direct Memory Access or PCIe Peer to Peer or something like this.
  * others function as their name indicates
* `userspace/src/`: `main` starts pipes required.
* `userspace/tests/`: test component shown above.
* kernel modules was planned for performance but... needs futher discussion.
